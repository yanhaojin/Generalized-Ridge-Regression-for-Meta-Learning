# Meta-Learning with Generalized Ridge Regression: High-dimensional Asymptotics, Optimality and Hyper-covariance Estimation

The sources codes for following tasks/experiments is contained in this github repository:
1. Code for estimating Stieltjies transform using surrogate data and by solving fixed point of corresponding equations
2. Code for experiments in Estimation of Omega changing the number of tasks L
3. Code for behavior of predictive risk based on (21) and MLE when changing n_{L+1}
4. Code for experiment under L1 regularized setting
5. Code for experiment for influence of choosing different lamda in Sparse case.
